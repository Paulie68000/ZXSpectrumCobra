# ZXSpectrumCobra
Full reverse engineered source code of Jonathan "Joffa" Smith's Cobra for the 48K Spectrum.

Back in the eighties I had the pleasure to work with Joff at Ocean / Special FX and later in the noughties at Warthog Games.

Cobra was an absolute Z80 masterpiece, and when Joff passed a lot of that knowledge passed with him.

As something of an archiver of old 8 bit source code I thought the source for Cobra should somehow be restored and explained for posterity.

Armed with the help of the wonderful Spectrum Analyser tool, I set about to fully document Cobra based on many long chats with Joff, and the pleasure of working with his code over the years; Joff was the master of creating highly reusable code that 
you see all through his numerous games.

After a few weeks of evenings, I present fully documented source code, named pretty much how he named his functions back in the day, as an ASM file that can be assembled by SJAsmPlus back into a
working snapshot file.

The code is heavily documented, but I'll add some more notes here on some of thinking behind the scrolling technique, the sprite plotting and the multiplexed "Plip Plop" audio player as they deserve
special attention, due to some proper oblique thinking!

Enjoy!
